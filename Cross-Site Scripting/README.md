Cross Site Scripting is a web vulnerability, which allows third party to execute malicious scripts, mostly JavaScript code into client's browser on behalf of web application.

Hardware and Software specification: Operating System (Kali Linux 4.19 amd-64) Tool: BeEf

XSS has been performed by using BeEf (Browser Exploitation framework) which is usually pre-installed on Kali Linux

a) To setup BeEf environment, install Ruby by command: 
$sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev

b) Obtain application source code either by downloading the latest archive: 
$ wget https://github.com/beefproject/beef/archive/master.zip

Or cloning the Git repository from Github: $ git clone https://github.com/beefproject/beef

c) Once a suitable version of Ruby is installed, run the install script in the BeEF directory:
$ ./install

d) To start BeEF, simply run:
$ ./beef
